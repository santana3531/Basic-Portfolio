	<p>
		This is my first time being a student since graduating high school. I'm hoping I can turn the knowledge I gain during these 6 months into a career in the sports world. I'm a New York Giants season ticket holder and would love to work within the organization in any way. Definitely would be  a dream come true. 
		<br>
		Other than the New York Giants there's not much I really care about. As pathetic as that sounds. It's very hard to make me mad or upset, I actually pride myself on always being in a good mood. However, when the Giants lose. It ruins my week. It's about the only thing that can ruin any good mood I'm in. So basically my life summed up is I work two jobs, go to school, and love the New York Giants.
